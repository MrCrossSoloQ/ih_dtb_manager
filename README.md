## Ice Hockey Database Manager
I decided to create my own ice hockey database composed of teams, players, and their game stats across various leagues. My goal is to use these stats to generate detailed analytics, because I love ice hockey statistics :)
This project is based on web scraping data from external websites or retrieving them via APIs, and then adjusting and storing them in a custom PostgreSQL database.

## Technologies
- Python 3
- psycopg2 (PostgreSQL connector)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Git

## Status
This project is a work in progress. Current functionality includes:
- Connecting to a PostgreSQL database
- Creating and filling tables
- Web scraping data about teams, players, and game results
- Adjusting raw data into structured database format
- Developing a custom API (in progress)
